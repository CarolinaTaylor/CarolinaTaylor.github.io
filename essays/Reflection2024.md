As a student of software engineering, I have come to realize that teamwork is fundamental to the development of any project. I experienced this firsthand with my recent project, where having a good team made a significant difference in delivering results to the customer. There is no doubt that working as a team allows for greater efficiency, better code quality, and faster adaptation to change. For example, we agreed to start this project using new tools like Next.js and MySQL, believing that we would learn a lot and gain experience with these technologies... but oh so little did we know about the challenges that we are about to face...

## Reviews

A significant part of the project involved team reviews. If you're not familiar with what team reviews are, let me explain. In this class, our team selects recently modified code or code that is considered in need of review. We describe the purpose of each file or collection, and then we follow a checklist. 

This checklist includes items that help ensure the code adheres to architectural principles, such as using lowercase for directories and following the correct directory structure, for example:

```
app/
    imports/
        api/
        startup/
        ui/
```

We also check the design for dead code, ensuring comments are clear and adding comments where necessary. For JavaScript, we avoid using `console.log` and make sure ESLint is enabled with no errors. Additionally, we review aspects related to Meteor, React, and testing.

After reviewing the code, we hold a 10-minute call to discuss the issues each team member found and their proposed solutions. Once everyone is clear on what to do, we close the review, and everyone continues working on their designated tasks. This process has been tremendously helpful in improving both the code quality and the overall quality of the product we are delivering.

## Customer Milestone

As part of the project, it was necessary to have several meetings with the customer, in this case, Spire. We held meetings every 3-4 weeks, during which each group in my class presented the implementation they had completed. After each presentation, the customer provided input and suggestions for improvement. They were there to help us and guide us through the UI design process, letting us know how they wanted the interface to look and the features they desired for the website, as well as the overall purpose of the site.

This part was crucial because, during the first milestone, we had very little guidance, resulting in a slow implementation. As a group, we were unsure about what to implement and how to meet their expectations, which made us a little afraid of disappointing them. However, after this time, we developed a clear understanding of what the customer was looking for then we could move fordward.

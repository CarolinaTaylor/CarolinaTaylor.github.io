## Is artificial intelligence going to replace developers??

Artificial intelligence is a revolutionary tool in this modern era. I believe that it has brought numerous benefits to my education and added an extra dimension to my research. AI can provide answers to questions at lightning speed, and the most amazing part is that, in most cases, the information provided is accurate. However, everything is not always perfect, and artificial intelligence is no exception. In this essay, I will share my experience with AI in my class, highlighting the unique and surprising aspects, as well as the challenges that made my life harder.

Why not ask an expert? Let's give the mic to ChatGPT.

[ChatGPT Question 1](https://chat.openai.com/share/2a67d803-0967-4b8b-89a9-dd448eb87cd1)
Explain how ChatGPT can be useful for learning functional programming and what to be careful of when using it for this.

```
ChatGPT can be a helpful resource for learning functional programming in several ways:

1. **Conceptual Explanations:** You can ask ChatGPT to explain fundamental concepts of functional programming, such as immutability, higher-order functions, pure functions, and lambda expressions. It can provide clear and concise explanations to help you understand these concepts better.

2. **Code Examples:** ChatGPT can generate functional programming code snippets based on your requests. This can be particularly useful for understanding how to implement certain features or concepts in a functional programming paradigm. You can ask for examples in languages like Haskell, Scala, or Lisp, which are known for their functional programming support.

After experiencing an amazing response from ChatGPT, I will deep into my personal experience and use of ChatGPT in the course of operating system ICS 314. I will discuss the pros and cons of using ChatGPT in this course. There were a number of experiences or assignments we were asked to do in order to achieve this.
 delve 

1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
2. In-class Practice WODs
3. In-class WODs
4. Essays
5. Final project
6. Learning a concept / tutorial
7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
8. Asking or answering a smart-question
9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
10. Explaining code
11. Writing code
12. Documenting code
13. Quality assurance 
14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed

To begin with, let me explain what a WOD is. In general, it is a timed quiz that serves as a preparation for a job interview, creating an environment that closely mimics a real interview, complete with a time limit to code. During this experience, I did not utilize Artificial Intelligence extensively, mainly because I did not have enough time to come up with the perfect prompts to ask the chatbot. As an overthinker, I decided to dive right in and start working as quickly as possible so that I could have time to figure things out on my own without relying on the chatbot and potentially receiving incorrect or unfamiliar answers. 

When I first used ChatGPT for WODs, the information it gave me was often too advanced, making simple exercises hard to understand.

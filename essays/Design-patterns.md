## Let's talk about Design Patterns

I have been using design patterns since the very beginning, but I have only recently realized how widely used they are. It's amazing how helpful they can be! When I was working on my final project in ICS 314, I used a well-known design pattern called the Singleton to solve an issue I was having with creating unique customer order confirmation IDs. This pattern allowed me to track inventory and keep track of which products were taken out of my inventory. It also allowed me to see how many products a user took with them. When a user returns a product, I can use the same pattern to look up the order ID that was created with a Singleton and know exactly which products were taken with the user. Impressive, right?
